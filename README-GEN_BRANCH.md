The purpose of the `gen` branch is to build a program that can generate C++ (and hopefully other language) code by parsing the `musicxml.xsd`.
This effort is part of issue [#58](https://github.com/webern/mx/issues/58).

The code-generating program is in the `CodeGen` directory and is written in Rust.
